# MAS212-Numerical-Methods
Assignment on numerical methods for solving ODEs (utilises Python).

This project explored the use of numerical methods in order to approximate solutions to systems of ODEs. This naturally produces inaccuracies and instabilities, and through the report (see pdf), and supplementary Python code, I have explored these methods.
