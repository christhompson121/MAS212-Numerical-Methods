# MAS212-Numerical-Methods
Assignment on numerical methods for solving ODEs (utilises Python).

This project explored the use of numerical methods in order to approximate solutions to systems of ODEs. This naturally produces inaccuracies and instabilities, and the report, with the supplementary Python code, I have explored these methods.
